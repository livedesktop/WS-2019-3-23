This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again.

Play anytime and anywhere, it only takes a moment to turn on your phone and help your child learn the ABCs!\r\n\r\nFeaturing three games in one:\r\n\r\nSpelling:\r\nA picture is shown on the screen with letters outlined just above it. Children match the letters at the top by choosing from the tiles below, placing them in the correct order to spell out words.\r\n\r\nFill In Blank:\r\nKids spell out the name of the picture using letters on the screen. There’s just one catch, though: all the letters are jumbled up!\r\n\r\nBlank Spelling:\r\nLetters are placed at the bottom of the screen, but this time there’s no clue at the top!\r\n\r\n\r\nABC Spelling was designed with both adults and children in mind. Kids will love the bright graphics, the easy to touch icons, and the fun cartoon drawings. Parents will love the report card feature that helps track learning progress.\r\n\r\nBest of all, ABC Spelling - Spell & Phonics is absolutely free, with no third party ads, paywalls, or other distractions.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Fun, educational activities for toddlers, kids, and parents alike!\r\n- Colorful graphics and wonderful animations to help kids learn.\r\n- Sounds to help children learn phonics for letters and words.\r\n- Report cards show learning progress so parents can help their kids at every turn.\r\n- Parents have complete control to set options and customize game modes to make learning more effective.\r\n- Collect stickers to celebrate learning achievements!\r\n\r\nNote to Parents: \r\n\r\nABC Spelling is a passion project for us. We want to reach kids across the world and give them an educational advantage. Children in cities, towns, even remote places where cell phones are more common than schools can benefit from a learning app like this one. There are so many kids who lack proper schooling, and that's why we want to remove as many barriers as possible to help them learn.\r\n\r\nAs parents, you can do a lot to help us spread the joy of education. Share this app with friends, family, schools, daycares, non-profit organizations, or simply post about it on Facebook or Twitter.

Wish to have an extra income or finding side jobs? Learning how to create an online course in udemy is a great way to get there! We will teach you how to build a successful online course and earn real money online and will generate a passive income.\r\nThe steep increase of online jobs and online business helped by the expansion of the Online world over the past 20 years or so has led to a great shift to internet resources. And why not, when we can locate and learn from excellent experts all around the planet at a nominal cost?\r\nWe are going to talk about the steps needed to build a Udemy course which is attractive, trustworthy, genuine and engaging that will get you that extra income working at home.\r\nHere are the lessons in that course:\r\n⭐ What Is Udemy?\r\nUdemy is a platform which brings a specialist and a pupil together. It is one of the best online websites for this purpose. Anybody can build a course on Udemy on any sort of subject through which they are knowledgeable, and earn money building an online course from home. \r\n\r\n⭐ How to build and launch your online course on Udemy?\r\nWe will look at the process of submitting your very first course, from registering, navigating to course building, discovering online courses that generate money online, creating a course, planning an online course, earning money from the online course and more.\r\n\r\n⭐ The Udemy online course revenue share model: \r\nThere is no charge involved in creating a course in Udemy.\r\nFor selling, Udemy provides different income models based upon if the lead is via Udemy's organic traffic, advertising campaign, affiliate marketing or entirely via the instructor.\r\n\r\n⭐ Create a road-map of Your online Course:\r\n1. Select the right topic-- You can either pick a subject which you are specialized in, or perhaps you can check out the popular courses that are offered on Udemy and choose a topic accordingly\r\n2. Identify your audience, determine the difficulty of the course, whether the course is a rookie's course or is an advanced course and, set objectives on your own and for your audience.\r\n3. Choose a Captivating Headline: it's extremely crucial to have a course headline which is catchy, short and descriptive. \r\n4. Decide the style for the Body of the Course Session: Lay out a strategy on exactly how will you break down all the sessions and pick a title for each section accordingly. \r\n\r\n⭐ Create Your online course content\r\nTo provide your viewers a spectacular and phenomenal feeling, it is very important that the quality of your lectures outstanding and satisfying. Like Video clip Recording, Sound Recording and Great content.\r\n\r\n⭐ Perfect Your Content and maximize online earnings\r\nMarketing web page of your online course will be the major factor in deciding the success of your course. Without a good and effective sales page, it would be impossible for you to develop a niche in the market and catch the attention of a potential viewers.\r\nThe landing page constitutes four main portions: \r\n1. Course Image (learn how you can easily get an incredible landing page designed from Odesk or Fiverr at an extremely small price).\r\n2. Course Summary: This is one of the most essential section that highlights what will a student learn in case he proceeds with the course (and pay money for it). \r\n3. Author Profile: Here is where you tell your prospective readers about yourself. It's highly recommended to have a comprehensive author profile since this can increase your CTR, and therefore ensure better conversions.\r\n4. Promo Video clip: Udemy recommends keeping the promo video precise (2-3 minutes) and basic. Highlight all the essential aspects of your course, and do not forget to add a call-to-action by the end of the video. \r\nLastly, decide on the price of the course, we suggest aiming for a good value for money course.\r\n\r\nWhat are waiting for? \r\n⭐Start earning money, Download now! ⭐\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P90N80CHT78","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"PDF Ink - Sign, Fill, Edit","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53889.14082042972092433.ae2e6457-0c82-428d-9445-77f0b1f62be2.202acedc-3fff-4f32-877c-da61569280a9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1327.14082042972092433.ae2e6457-0c82-428d-9445-77f0b1f62be2.ad8136f4-2ca6-46b4-a455-5cb18df178eb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25765.14082042972092433.f0d55342-ead8-4a06-b55e-ce3dd690f6bb.be4ca095-0fb7-4d6d-81d4-44310d252ea4","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4247.14082042972092433.f0d55342-ead8-4a06-b55e-ce3dd690f6bb.c6a649b1-eca8-4f9c-87a2-59b21291b463","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["36376UserCamp.PDFInk_t7afzrbtd67z0"],"ContentIds":["6a42afec-4065-1c46-16ec-32a5158d039c","017e648d-1a26-0d07-fb9d-d3107ed33b10"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Sign, annotate, and fill in PDFs for free with PDF Ink. \r\n\r\nPDF Ink lets you insert your signature, typed text, and ink into any PDF document.

Download your Mate Edge translator today and never feel lost in language again.\r\n\r\nThe Mate Translate Edge Extension allows you to highlight any word or text on a webpage and instantly translate it by pressing the shortcut or double-clicking with your mouse. Using the shortcuts will create a small unobtrusive pop-up screen with your direct translation highlighted right there in front of you. No need to click to a new screen or browser window. Mate’s translation with a click feature ensures you never need to leave the page you’re on or interrupt your work flow. Mate saves you time and keeps you on track.\r\n\r\nMate has an incredibly comprehensive instant translation database of 103 languages. No matter what language you need help with, Mate has your back. Mate provides phonetic transcription of any translated word in any language into the international phonetic alphabet. That means you can enter a Chinese character and Mate will tell you how to pronounce it and even transcript it phonetically. Mate doesn’t just help you read in your target language, it teaches you how to speak and understand it. Download today and view our expansive 103 language list.\r\n\r\nMate stores all your translations offline so that you can reference them whenever you want. You can install Mate on a variety of devices and Mate will synchronize between all of them. Mate allows you to instantly translate a phrase on your Mac and then you can access it on another desktop or mobile device. Never lose a translation again, even between devices!\r\n\r\nMate’s Phrasebook functionality allows you to curate personal phrasebooks that you can access quickly and easily on any device. Language learners love using phrasebook to create custom lists for classes or common situations they find themselves in. Instead of creating bulky flashcards just create a Mate Phrasebook word list and study on any device no matter where you are. Phrasebook is also perfect for travelers. Never forget how to say or pronounce, \"where is the bathroom?\" or \"what’s your number?\" in any language ever again. Your Phrasebook synchronizes across all your Mate devices, and can be curated offline too.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PJHV2VSX6GL","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Followers Insight","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27779.14282013657343433.b24abebf-df44-472a-98f7-f583a9516d88.3c26b2b8-5d1a-463c-a373-2963b2c5a584","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["17035ArefGihuni.InstaFollow_m1a0wcfyvfcq4"],"ContentIds":["935846f3-c6bd-9bbe-5cc8-8fd5b193d335","b88adc0a-59df-11f6-0e17-f4926b6316f4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you ever wanted to know who unfollowed you, blocked you or who is not following you back, or if you want to automatically like photos in a hashtag to get more followers this app is what you need!\r\n\r\n■ Features:\r\n   ✓ New Followers: shows you a list of your recent new followers.\r\n   ✓ Lost Followers: shows you a list of your unfollowers. you can view their profile and maybe unfollow them too!\r\nUsing these features you can find out if your recent post was favorable to your followers or not.\r\n   ✓ Blockers: If any of your followers or accounts that you follow block you, they will appear hear.\r\n   ✓ Mutual Friends: Find out who is following you back.\r\n   ✓ Non Followers: If you ever wanted to know who is not following you back, you can catch them here.\r\n   ✓ Fans: Your true supporters.

This app version is my Retirement gift to you! The application is FREE with 100% FULL functionality, is now 100% AD FREE, and NO longer requires an internet connection. The Guitar Chord Collections application provides quick access by root tone and chord type to over 4000 guitar chords. All animated chord box and full fretboard views display the chord name and the common abbreviated symbol, fret numbers, a suggested fingering, as well as tone and interval labeling. To play the chord simply tap or click one of the four buttons at the bottom of the chord box or fretboard to listen to the full chord as a strum down, strum up, or as an arpeggio up or down one note at a time in sequence. You may also play single chord tones by tapping or clicking directly on the note in the chord box or fretboard.  To view and play the scale tones from which the chord is derived simply swipe from the bottom of the screen, or right click, to open the lower application bar and then tap or click the Scale button. In addition to a full chord dictionary users may access chords directly via their associated chord family collection. Finally, the Moveable Collection, is a great learning tool to allow you to view, play, and learn moveable chords in five different shapes (CAGED System) and positions on a full 21 fret fretboard view. There are option settings for volume playback as well as left or right handed preference for chord box and fretboard views.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKDNJ","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Math Kid Grade 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.62980.9007199266528599.4605b828-18b3-4520-bacb-fa88ab49e772.8760d70c-a46c-436c-85ea-e74a3e7a13e7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"green","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.7393.9007199266528599.3238b7b2-1f57-4261-bbac-d2a71ef0d02b.95b76858-9677-41f7-bc94-9134b4eda80d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"green","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["3MbSolutions.MathKidGrade3_rga26mbr2qrx0"],"ContentIds":["8999fb42-9ca0-ad02-d2f6-86fbab4fe8ac"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"***********  Learning Made Easy  ***********\r\nMath Kid Grade 3 is a great educational tools for school-age children.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles.
