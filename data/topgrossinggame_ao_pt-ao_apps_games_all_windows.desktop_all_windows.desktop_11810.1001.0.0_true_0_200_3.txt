As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe object is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began. The bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership. Spades is a descendant of the Whist family of card games, which also includes Bridge, Hearts, and Oh, Hell. Its major difference as compared to other Whist variants is that, instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random, the Spade suit is always trump, hence the name. \r\n\r\nA standard pack of 52 cards is used ranked from highest to lowest: \r\nA, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. \r\nThe four players are in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal rotates clockwise. The cards are shuffled and dealt clockwise. \r\nAll four players bid a number of tricks. Each team adds together the bids - number of tricks that team must try to win in order to get a positive score. Everyone must bid a number. Players are not allowed to pass and bids once made cannot be altered. A bid of 0 tricks is known as Nil. This is a declaration that that the player who bid Nil will not win any tricks during the play. There is an extra bonus for this if it succeeds and a penalty if it fails. The partnership also has the objective of winning the number of tricks bid by the Nil's partner. \r\n\r\nThe player to dealer's left leads any card (except a spade). Each player, in turn, clockwise, must follow suit if able; if unable to follow suit, the player may play any card. \r\nA trick containing a spade is won by the highest spade played; if no spade is played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next. Spades may not be led until either some player has played a spade, or the leader has nothing but spades left in hand. \r\nA side that takes at least as many tricks as its bid calls for receives a score equal to 10 times its bid. Additional tricks (bags) are worth an extra one point each. A side which (over several deals) accumulates 10 or more bags has 100 points deducted from its score. Any bags beyond 10 are carried over to the next cycle. If a side does not make its bid, they lose 10 points for each trick they bid. If a bid of nil is successful, the nil bidder's side receives 100 points addition to the score won (or lost) by the partner of the nil bidder for tricks made. If a bid of nil fails - that is, the bidder takes at least one trick - the bidder's side loses 100 points, but still receives any amount scored for the partner's bid. \r\nThe usual rule is that when a nil fails, the tricks won by the nil bidder do not count towards making the partner's bid, but do count as bags for the team. The side which reaches 500 points first wins the game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMCJH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Monster Truck","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16210.9007199266439748.366cfc3a-5487-4925-ab4f-4ad900677dcd.be66f4e8-955c-4164-983c-98eefc60606b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#202020","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratuito","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["OmniGSoftwareInc.MonsterTruck_5nhr6keq12396"],"ContentIds":["0048ef67-e582-a14c-35e7-8477e69d7c72"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Monster Truck is a fantastic real-time 3D fantasy racing game offers gorgeous graphics and loads of high speed fun!\r\nPlow down rivals and tear through obstacles with your roaring monster truck.

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for. Travel with Ingolf along the picturesque lands, help the locals solve their problems, make friends with a wise Druid and, most importantly, find Loki to deliver the Viking king from the curse of the ring! \r\n\r\nJOIN US! \r\n\r\nEnjoy Realore Games at: http://www.realore.com \r\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealoreGame \r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealoreGames \r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.realore.com/appprivacypolicy.php","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDXQWR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Panda painting 1","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9001.9007199266693438.f4603c74-903a-4e4e-9e6f-14dd5aa4fc04.1c1d1169-83b2-4ea1-bbfe-1a48e8a35623","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratuito⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["6E921299.Pandapainting1_qya02bbca3nca"],"ContentIds":["0b81c560-d7d0-09c2-474f-4529c13967ba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Three to four months after birth, the baby starts to feel the different colors.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line.

Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NXR6469DM2P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Crackdown 3","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63949.14494915233617130.8bc2d647-9563-4ed3-9081-f4a771cfa3a6.6504c19a-15a5-40a6-9231-343598749956","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24344.14494915233617130.8bc2d647-9563-4ed3-9081-f4a771cfa3a6.876524bb-291a-4484-8f20-fcef8017b53c","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$59.99⁺","Price":59.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Time to step up your boom and stop crime as a super-powered Agent in Crackdown 3's open-world sandbox of mayhem and destruction.
